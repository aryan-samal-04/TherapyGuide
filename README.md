Program Overview:

Therapy Guide is a Java application that auto-selects a set of therapy postures to be administered
based on the desired body part needing physical therapy. It displays both a visual representation
of postures and associated text-based instructions. The application uses a series of left-panel
buttons in the GUI where the user can choose which part of the body they want to work out: feet,
knees, hips, trunk, or hamstrings. Based on the body part the user chooses, another series of buttons
at the bottom of the screen, each with a different icon showing the main part of the exercise.
Once the user chooses which specific exercise they want to work on by clicking on one of the bottom
panel buttons, an image of the physical therapy exercise along with a title and instructions explaining
how to perform the exercise will appear.
