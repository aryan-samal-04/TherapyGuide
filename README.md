TherapyGuide Application Overview:

Therapy Guide is an application that displays both visual and text-based physical therapy
information. The application uses a series of buttons displayed in a GUI where the user
can choose which part of the body they want to work out: feet, knees, hips, trunk, or hamstrings.
Based on the body part the user chooses, another series of buttons at the bottom of the screen will
appear, each with a different icon showing the main part of the exercise. Once the user choose which
specific exercise they want to complete by clicking on one of the bottom panel buttons, a picture of
the physical therapy exercise along with a title and text explaining how to perform the exercise will appear.
